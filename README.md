  LetsCode Online Compiler
</h1>

![demo](public/page.png)

#### A simple online compiler that allows you to write and compile/execute code. The initial intent of this project was to create an online compiler that allows teachers to create a session (they can upload a pdf file) for exams instead of writing on a paper, students will have to join a session with the session id generated by the teacher when creating the session and thier full name, after a successful connection they will be directed to the main page, just like in the image below :point_down:, they would be automatically disconnected if thier mouse leaves the page or if they change the window, (there is toast when you try to leave the page to warn you)
